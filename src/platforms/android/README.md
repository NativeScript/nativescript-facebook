# Android permissions and dependencies

* (Optional) Use AndroidManifest.xml to describe any permissions, features or other configuration specifics required or used by your plugin for Android. 
NOTE: The NativeScript CLI will not resolve any contradicting or duplicate entries during the merge. After the plugin is installed, you need to manually resolve such issues.

* (Optional) Use include.gradle configuration to describe any native dependencies. If there are no such, this file can be removed. For more information, see the [include.gradle Specification](http://docs.nativescript.org/plugins/plugins#includegradle-specification)
